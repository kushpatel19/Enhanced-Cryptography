# Enhanced-Encryption-Decryption


Cryptography is not a new concept. Rather, it has been in use for thousands of years now. It is the study of mathematical methods pertaining to aspects of security of information like data integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and data origin authentication. It does not only mean hiding information. Rather it is a set of techniques which can be implemented to code a data, send it to the intended receiver, and should be easily unpackable by them. In this project, we have aimed to  implement a symmetric encryption-decryption algorithm. 

The project is done by 4 other member also. We have used the following methods in our project.

- Symmetric Key Excahnge Algorithm
- Encryption Algorithm
- Decryption Algorithm
- Diffie-Hellman Algorithm
- Numerical Methods
  - Bisection Method
  - Newton-Raphson Method
  - Secant Method
